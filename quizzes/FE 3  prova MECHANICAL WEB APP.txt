--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using Newton's Second Law, F = ma. Acceleration (a) = Force (F) / Mass (m). Thus, a = 20 N / 5 kg = 4 m/s².

2. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: At the highest point, velocity is zero. Using v = u + at, where v = 0, u = 15 m/s, and g = -9.8 m/s², the time to reach the highest point is t = u / g = 15 / 9.8 ≈ 1.5 seconds.

3. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The natural frequency is proportional to the square root of (1 / mass). Doubling the mass reduces the frequency to √(1/2) of the original, or 5 Hz * √(1/2) ≈ 2.5 Hz.

4. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the equation v² = u² + 2as, where v = 0, u = 20 m/s, a = -2 m/s², solve for s: s = u² / (2|a|) = 20² / (2 * 2) = 100 m.

5. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Vertical velocity component = u * sin(θ) = 20 * sin(45°) ≈ 14.14 m/s. Maximum height = (v²) / (2g) = (14.14²) / (2 * 9.8) ≈ 15 m.

6. Correct Answer: B

7. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Frictional force is given by F = μ * m * g. Substituting μ = 0.3, m = 50 kg, and g = 9.8 m/s² gives F = 0.3 * 50 * 9.8 ≈ 150 N.

8. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Using v = u + at, v = 5 + (3 * 4) = 20 m/s.

9. Correct Answer: B

15. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The period of a simple pendulum is given by T = 2π√(L/g). Substituting L = 2 m and g = 9.8 m/s², T = 2π√(2/9.8) ≈ 3.14 s.

16. Correct Answer: C

   Explanation: The vertical velocity is v*sin(45°). Using h = v²/(2g), where g = 9.8 m/s², calculate maximum height using components.

23. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The net force is F_net = Applied force - Friction force. Friction force is calculated as f_k = μ_k * (m * g). Plugging in values, F_net = 100 - (0.3 * 15 * 9.81) ≈ 55.9 N. Using F_net = m * a, we find a ≈ 55.9 / 15 ≈ 4.4 m/s².

24. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Use the equation of motion h = 0.5 * g * t². Rearrange to solve for t: t = √(2h/g). Substituting h = 100 m and g = 9.81 m/s² results in t ≈ √(200/9.81) ≈ 5.0 seconds.

25. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The period of a spring-mass system is T = 2π√(m/k). Substituting m = 3 kg and k = 100 N/m gives T ≈ 2π√(3/100) ≈ 1.09 seconds.

26. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Use the kinematic equation v² = u² + 2as. Rearrange to find a: a = (v² - u²) / (2s). Substituting v = 15, u = 5, and s = 50 gives a = (225 - 25) / 100 = 1.0 m/s².

27. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The net force is the weight of Block B minus the friction force for Block A. Using F_net = m_total * a and solving for a gives a = (m_B * g) / (m_A + m_B). Substituting values, a ≈ (3 * 9.81) / (5 + 3) ≈ 1.2 m/s².

28. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The damped frequency is ω_d = ω_n√(1 - ζ²). Substituting ω_n = 5 and ζ = 0.1 gives ω_d ≈ 5√(1 - 0.01) ≈ 4.98 rad/s.

29. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Convert velocity to m/s: 80 km/h = 22.22 m/s. Using a = (v - u) / t, a = (0 - 22.22) / 4 ≈ -4.44 m/s² (deceleration).

30. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Linear velocity v = ωr. When r = 1.0 m and ω = 6 rad/s, v = 6 * 1.0 = 6 m/s.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The hydrostatic force is calculated as F = ρghA. The depth to the center of pressure is 2 m + (4 m/2) = 4 m. Using ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.81 m/s², and A = 3 × 4 = 12 m², the force is F = (1000)(9.81)(4)(12) = 176.4 kN.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the principle of continuity, A₁v₁ = A₂v₂. The area of the larger pipe is A₁ = π(0.3/2)² = 0.0707 m², and the area of the smaller pipe is A₂ = π(0.15/2)² = 0.0177 m². Solving for v₂ gives v₂ = A₁v₁/A₂ = (0.0707 × 2) / 0.0177 = 8 m/s.

3. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Apply Bernoulli's equation: P₁ + 0.5ρv₁² = P₂ + 0.5ρv₂². First, find v₂ using continuity: v₂ = (A₁v₁)/A₂. A₁ = π(0.5/2)² = 0.196 m² and A₂ = π(0.25/2)² = 0.049 m². So, v₂ = (0.196 × 3) / 0.049 = 12 m/s. Substitute into Bernoulli's equation: 150,000 + 0.5(1000)(3)² = P₂ + 0.5(1000)(12)². Solve for P₂: P₂ = 90,500 Pa = 90.5 kPa.

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: For laminar flow in a circular pipe, the average velocity is half the maximum velocity. Hence, the average velocity is v_avg = v_max / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 m/s.

5. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The number of dimensionless groups is given by the formula n - r, where n is the number of variables, and r is the number of fundamental dimensions. Here, n = 4 and r = 3 (M, L, T). Thus, there are 4 - 3 = 1 dimensionless group, and that group represents the Reynolds number.

6. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: From the Moody chart, for Re = 15,000 and a relative roughness of 0.001, the friction factor f is approximately 0.016.

7. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The flow rate Q is given by Q = A × v, where A is the cross-sectional area. For a rectangular channel, A = width × depth = 3 × 2 = 6 m². Solve for v: v = Q / A = 30 / 6 = 5 m/s.

8. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The pump efficiency is η = (ρgQH) / P. Using ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.81 m/s², Q = 0.1 m³/s, H = 20 m, and P = 10,000 W, η = [(1000)(9.81)(0.1)(20)] / 10,000 = 0.70 = 70%.

9. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The pressure at the bottom of the tank is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure = ρgh = (1000)(9.81)(8) = 78.48 kPa. Adding atmospheric pressure, total pressure = 101.3 + 78.48 = 178.3 kPa.

10. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the Bernoulli equation and continuity, the flow rate can be calculated as Q = A₁A₂√(2ΔP/ρ)/(√(A₁² - A₂²)), where A₁ = π(0.4/2)², A₂ = π(0.2/2)², ΔP = 20,000 Pa, and ρ = 1000 kg/m³. Substituting values gives Q ≈ 0.126 m³/s.

11. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The density of the fluid can be calculated as ρ = μ/ν, where μ is the dynamic viscosity and ν is the kinematic viscosity. Substituting values: ρ = 0.5 / 0.0005 = 1000 kg/m³.

12. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The power output is given by P = ρgQHη, where ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.81 m/s², Q = 0.3 m³/s, H = 50 m, and η = 0.85. Substituting values: P = (1000)(9.81)(0.3)(50)(0.85) ≈ 150 kW.

13. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The hydraulic radius is R = A/P, where A is the cross-sectional area and P is the wetted perimeter. A = b*d + z*d² = 4*3 + 2*3² = 24 m². P = b + 2√(1+z²)*d = 4 + 2√(1+4)*3 ≈ 13.3 m. R = 24 / 13.3 ≈ 1.8 m.

14. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: There are 5 variables (F, V, D, ρ, μ) and 3 fundamental dimensions (M, L, T). Therefore, the number of π groups is 5 - 3 = 2.

15. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: For incompressible flow, the divergence of the velocity field must be zero. ∇·V = ∂(2x)/∂x + ∂(3y)/∂y + ∂(4z)/∂z = 2 + 3 + 4 ≠ 0. Thus, the flow is compressible.

16. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The equivalent resistance for parallel pipes is given by 1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃. Substituting values: 1/R_eq = 1/5 + 1/10 + 1/15 ≈ 0.3. R_eq = 1/0.3 ≈ 3.33.

17. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The force due to viscous drag can be approximated for laminar flow as F = μUWL, where μ = 0.02 Pa.s, U = 4 m/s, W = 1 m, L = 2 m. F = 0.02 × 4 × 2 × 1 = 1.28 N.
