--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: To solve for x, add 7 to both sides: 5x = 25. Divide both sides by 5: x = 5.

2. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Using the Pythagorean Theorem: 7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625, which equals 25^2. Therefore, it is a right triangle.

3. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Total scores = 84 × 5 = 420. The sum of 4 scores = 80 + 85 + 83 + 86 = 334. Fifth score = 420 - 334 = 84.

4. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Average speed = Total distance ÷ Total time. 300 ÷ 5 = 60 mph.

5. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Substitute y = 7 into the equation: 7 = 2x + 3. Subtract 3: 4 = 2x. Divide by 2: x = 1.

6. Correct Answer: A

   Explanation: Producers, such as plants, convert solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis, serving as the base of the food chain.

85. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Sodium (Na) is a metal that readily loses an electron to form a positive ion, while chlorine (Cl) gains an electron to form a negative ion. Together, they form an ionic bond.

86. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: As the toy car moves downward, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy due to the force of gravity acting on it.

87. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can absorb, improving soil fertility.

88. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Rusting is a chemical reaction where iron combines with oxygen in the presence of moisture, a process known as oxidation.

89. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava, which is common at volcanic eruption sites.

90. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: At the highest point, the ball temporarily stops moving upwards, making its kinetic energy zero. Potential energy is at its maximum due to its height.

91. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The kidneys filter waste from the blood and regulate fluid and electrolyte balance in the body.

92. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: In a gas, molecules move randomly and are widely spaced, resulting in high compressibility.

93. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Increased seismic activity along fault lines is a key indicator of potential earthquakes caused by the movement of tectonic plates.

94. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Due to the force of gravity, the diver's speed increases as they fall towards the ground.

95. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Roots anchor plants in the soil and absorb water and nutrients needed for growth.

96. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: According to Charles's Law, the volume of a gas increases as its temperature increases, provided pressure remains constant.

97. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Tidal waves and currents can cause the erosion of soil in coastal regions by washing away sediments.

98. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Centripetal force keeps satellites in orbit by pulling them towards the center of the Earth as they move in a circular path.

99. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating gametes for reproduction.

100. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Evaporation is an endothermic process because it absorbs heat from the surroundings to convert liquid water into vapor.
