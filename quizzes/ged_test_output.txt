--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The probability of no failure for a single component is (1-0.02) = 0.98. For 5 independent components, the probability of no failure is 0.98^5 = 0.9039. The correct answer is A.

2. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a normal distribution, approximately 68.2% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. Here, 9.7 to 10.7 mm is one standard deviation from the mean (10.2 ± 0.5), so the probability is 0.682.

3. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The probability of selecting no defective units is (1 - 0.03)^5 = 0.857. Thus, the probability of selecting at least one defective unit is 1 - 0.857 = 0.859.

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The probability for a uniform distribution is calculated by (desired range) / (total range). Here, (7 - 0) / (10 - 0) = 0.7.

5. Correct Answer: A

42. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a normal distribution, approximately 68.2% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. Hence, the probability is 0.682.

43. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Using the Weibull cumulative distribution function: P(T ≤ t) = 1 - exp[-(t/λ)^k], where λ = 2000, k = 1.5, and t = 1500. Substituting and solving gives approximately 0.78.

44. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the formula for the confidence interval: mean ± z * (σ/sqrt(n)), with z = 1.96 for 95% confidence, σ = 0.1 mm, n = 30. The interval is 5.2 ± 1.96*(0.1/√30), which is approximately 5.15 mm to 5.25 mm.

45. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For an exponential distribution, P(T > t) = exp(-t/λ). Here, λ = 1000 and t = 1500. Substituting gives P(T > 1500) = exp(-1500/1000) ≈ 0.223.

46. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the z-score for the 90th percentile (z = 1.28), the formula is: X = mean + z * standard deviation. Substituting: X = 500 + 1.28 * 20 = 516 MPa.

47. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The probability of no failures is (1 - 0.02)^150 ≈ 0.027. Therefore, the probability of at least one failure is 1 - 0.027 = 0.973.

48. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: This is a binomial distribution problem: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n = 20, k = 2, p = 0.05. Substituting gives P(X = 2) ≈ 0.188.

49. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Using Bayes' theorem: P(B|D) = (P(D|B) * P(B)) / P(D), where P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B). Substituting gives P(B|D) = (0.05*0.4) / [0.03*0.6 + 0.05*0.4] ≈ 0.67.

50. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a uniform distribution, P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = (b - a) / (max - min). Substituting: P(8 ≤ X ≤ 12) = (12 - 8) / (15 - 5) = 0.4.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The NPV is calculated by summing the present values of each cash flow using the formula PV = CF / (1 + r)^n. Subtracting the initial investment gives an NPV of $2,890.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The annual depreciation is ($100,000 - $10,000) / 10 = $9,000. After 5 years, total depreciation is 5 × $9,000 = $45,000. Book value = $100,000 - $45,000 = $55,000.

3. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: BCR = (Present Value of Benefits) / (Present Value of Costs). Using the Present Value of an annuity formula, BCR is found to be 1.30.

4. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Break-even quantity = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Cost). Substituting values gives 4,000 units.

5. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Payback period is calculated as initial investment divided by annual cash inflow. $40,000 / $10,000 = 4 years.

6. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total cost for each machine is calculated using the Present Worth Method. Machine B has a lower total present cost and is more economical.

7. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The effective discount rate is calculated using (1 + nominal rate) = (1 + real rate)(1 + inflation rate). This results in an effective rate of 11.24%.

8. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: EAC is calculated by dividing the total present cost of the machine by the annuity factor. Substituting values, the EAC of the new machine is $7,800.

9. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: If the IRR is greater than the company's required rate of return, the project is considered a good investment, so the company should accept it.

10. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The sensitivity is calculated as the change in NPV divided by the percentage change in cash inflows. ($25,000 - $10,000) / 10% = $2,500 per %.

11. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The net present value (NPV) is calculated using the formula for discounted cash flows. A positive NPV indicates the investment yields returns above the required rate of return.

12. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The declining balance method applies the depreciation rate to the remaining book value each year. After three years, the book value is calculated as $60,000 * (1 - 0.2)^3 = $30,720.

13. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The breakeven point is calculated using the formula Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Cost). Thus, $90,000 / ($75 - $25) = 3,600 units.

14. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The NPV is calculated by discounting the annual savings over 10 years and subtracting the initial cost. Using the formula for present value of annuities, NPV = ($5,000 * P/A, 5%, 10) - $30,000 = $22,278.

15. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The payback period is calculated as Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflows. In this case, $80,000 / $20,000 = 4 years, which is within the 5-year limit.

16. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Interest is calculated as Principal * Rate * Years. Here, $500,000 * 0.08 * 5 = $200,000.

17. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total cash inflow is calculated using the formula for compound growth: $30,000 * (1 + 0.03)^5 = $159,274.

18. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Opportunity cost is the difference in returns between the chosen project and the next best alternative: $100,000 * (0.12 - 0.08) = $4,000.

19. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Savings are calculated by comparing the operating costs and accounting for the time value of money: ($10,000 - $5,000) * P/A, 10%, 5 = $15,000.

20. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The NPV decreases by $20,000 for each 1% increase in the discount rate. At 12%, the NPV is $50,000 - (2 * $20,000) = $30,000.

21. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total cost for each method can be equated as: 100,000 + 50x = 150,000 + 30x. Solving for x gives 2,500 units.

22. Correct Answer: B

21. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the equations of static equilibrium, sum moments about the roller support to find the reaction at the hinge. The hinge balances both vertical and horizontal forces.

22. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The horizontal reaction at the pin is zero because there is no horizontal force applied to the frame.

23. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The maximum tension can be calculated using the geometry of the cable and the equilibrium of forces. Use trigonometry to find the horizontal tension.

24. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The cable that is shorter or closer to the weight supports a greater portion of the load due to geometry and equilibrium conditions.

25. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The floor only counters the vertical weight of the sphere, as there is no friction or additional vertical force applied.

26. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The total load can be calculated by integrating the triangular distributed load over the length of the beam.

27. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: For a two-force member to be in equilibrium, the forces must be equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear.

28. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The horizontal force at the base must balance the horizontal reaction at the wall, and in this case, it equals the ladder's weight due to the 45° angle.

29. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Use the determinacy equation for a truss: m + r = 2j. Here, m=15, r=3, and j=8, making the structure statically determinate.

30. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The resultant force acts closer to the larger force. Use the principle of moments to find its location relative to the 300 N force.

31. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a planar truss, the equation for static determinacy is m + r = 2j, where m is the number of members, r is the number of reaction forces, and j is the number of joints. Solving 23 + r = 2(10), we find r = 3.

32. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the equation of moments about the left support, the reaction at the right support (R2) is calculated as R2 = (400 N × 2 m) / 6 m = 133.33 N. Using equilibrium of vertical forces, the reaction at the right support is then R2 = 266.67 N.

36. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Because the force is entirely horizontal and the roller only provides vertical support, there is no vertical reaction force at the roller.

37. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The horizontal component of tension is equal throughout the cable. Using trigonometry, T_horizontal = T_support × cos(θ). Given θ = arcsin(500/1000), T_horizontal ≈ 866 N.

38. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Taking moments about the hinge, the vertical force is found by equating the clockwise moment due to the weight and the counterclockwise moment due to the applied force. Force = (60 N × 1.5 m) / 3 m = 30 N.

39. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The location of the resultant force for a triangular load is at 2/3 of the length from the smaller end. Thus, the location is (2/3) × 4 m = 2.67 m.

40. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The weight of the sphere is balanced by the vertical components of the two equal reaction forces. Using symmetry and trigonometry, each reaction force is W / (2cos(45°)) = 100 N / (2 × 0.707) ≈ 70.7 N.

41. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total load of a uniformly varying load is the area of the triangular load distribution. The base of the triangle is 5 m, and the height is 300 N/m. Area = 0.5 × base × height = 0.5 × 5 × 300 = 750 N.

44. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The bending moment at the fixed end of a cantilever beam under a point load is given by M = P × L. Here, M = 200 N × 4 m = 800 Nm.

45. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a truss to be statically determinate, it must satisfy the equation: m + r = 2j, where m is the number of members, r is the reaction forces, and j is the joints. Substituting m = 20 and j = 8 gives r = 3.

46. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The frictional force resisting the weight of the disk is given by F_friction = μ × F. Setting F_friction = 500 N, we solve for F as F = 500 N / 0.5 = 500 N.

47. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: A pinned support can resist both vertical and horizontal forces but not moments. Therefore, both vertical and horizontal reaction forces are present at the pinned support.

48. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: For a simply supported beam under a uniformly distributed load w, the maximum bending moment occurs at the center and is given by M_max = (w × L^2) / 8. Substituting w = 500 N/m and L = 6 m, M_max = (500 × 6^2) / 8 = 4500 Nm.

49. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: If one cable becomes loose, the number of unknowns decreases by one. To restore equilibrium, only one additional reaction force is required.

50. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The frictional force matches the applied force until the maximum static friction force is reached. Here, the block does not move, so the frictional force equals the applied force of 60 N.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The acceleration is the second derivative of the position function. x(t) = 3t^3 - 6t^2 + 2t. Velocity, v(t) = dx/dt = 9t^2 - 12t + 2. Acceleration, a(t) = dv/dt = 18t - 12. At t = 2, a(2) = 18(2) - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12 m/s^2.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using Newton’s second law, F = ma. a = F/m = 20/5 = 4 m/s^2. Using v = u + at and u = 0, v = 0 + 4(4) = 16 m/s.

3. Correct Answer: B

41. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The maximum static friction force is F_f = μ_s * N = 0.4 * (10 * 9.81) = 39.24 N. Since the applied force (30 N) is less than this value, the block will not start moving.

42. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the kinematic equation v² = u² + 2as, where v = 0, u = 25 m/s, a = -5 m/s², solving for s gives s = (25²)/(2 * 5) = 62.5 m.

43. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For underdamping, the condition is (c² < 4mk), where c is the damping coefficient and m is the mass. Substituting c = 0.5 and m = 1, solving for k gives k > 0.25 N/m.

44. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The tension is T = m(g + a) = 500(9.81 + 2) = 500 * 11.81 = 5905 N. Therefore, the tension in the cable is approximately 5900 N.

45. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The time to reach the peak is found using v = u + at, where v = 0, u = 20 m/s, and a = -9.81 m/s². Solving for t gives t = u/(-a) = 20/9.81 ≈ 2 seconds.

46. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The natural frequency is given by f = (1/2π)√(k/m). Rearranging for k, k = (2πf)²m = (2π * 5)² * 4 ≈ 200 N/m.

47. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The acceleration is a = g(sinθ - μ_k cosθ). Substituting g = 9.81 m/s², θ = 30°, and μ_k = 0.2, a = 9.81(sin30° - 0.2cos30°) ≈ 2.94 m/s².

48. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using v = u + at, where u = 0, a = 15 m/s², and t = 10 s, v = 0 + (15 * 10) = 150 m/s.

49. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total energy in SHM is E = (1/2)kA². Substituting k = 100 N/m and A = 0.5 m, E = 0.5 * 100 * (0.5)² = 25 J.

50. Correct Answer: A

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Stress (σ) is calculated using the formula σ = P/A, where P is the load and A is the cross-sectional area. The cross-sectional area of the rod is A = π/4 * d² = π/4 * (12 mm)². Substituting P = 30 kN, the stress is σ = 30,000 N / (π/4 * (12)^2 mm²). The result is 265.3 N/mm².

2. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Maximum shear stress (τ_max) for a biaxial stress state is given by τ_max = √((σ_x - σ_y)/2)² + τ_xy². Here σ_x = 50 MPa, σ_y = 0 MPa (since no compressive stress is given), and τ_xy = 25 MPa. Substituting, τ_max = √((50 - 0)/2)² + (25)² = 37.5 MPa.

3. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a simply supported beam with a uniform load, the maximum bending moment occurs at the center and is given by M_max = wL²/8. Here, w = 10 kN/m and L = 6 m. Substituting, M_max = 10 * (6)² / 8 = 45 kN·m.

4. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Shear stress (τ) in a shaft is given by τ = T*r/J, where T is the torque, r is the radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid circular shaft, J = π/32 * d⁴. Substituting T = 500 Nm, d = 40 mm, τ = (500 * 20) / (π/32 * (40)⁴) = 31.83 MPa.

5. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The critical buckling load (P_cr) is given by P_cr = π²EI/(L_eff)². For pinned ends, the effective length L_eff = L = 2 m = 2000 mm. Substituting E = 200 GPa, I = 80,000 mm⁴, P_cr = π² * 200,000 * 80,000 / (2000)² = 50.26 kN.

6. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Lateral strain is given by ε_lat = -ν * σ/E, where ν is Poisson’s ratio, σ is the stress, and E is Young’s modulus. Substituting ν = 0.3, σ = 150 MPa, and E = 210 GPa, ε_lat = -0.3 * (150/210,000) = -0.000214.

7. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: For a simply supported beam with a central point load, maximum deflection δ_max = (P*L³)/(48*EI). Substituting P = 10 kN, L = 5 m, EI = 200,000 kN·m², δ_max = (10 * 5³) / (48 * 200,000) = 0.0052 m.

8. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The stress amplitude is given directly as the alternating stress, which is 150 MPa.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the First Law of Thermodynamics: Q = ΔU + W. ΔU = m * (u2 - u1) = 0.5 * (300 - 200) = 50 kJ. Therefore, Q = 50 + 50 = 150 kJ.

2. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Using the Carnot efficiency formula, η = 1 - (T_low / T_high) = 1 - (300 / 600) = 0.5. Since η = W/Q_in, Q_in = W/η = 200 / 0.5 = 400 kJ.

3. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Entropy increases during an irreversible process such as free expansion. In this case, there is no heat transfer but the disorder of the system increases.

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Since the tank is rigid, there is no work done. Using the First Law: Q = ΔU = m * Cv * (T2 - T1) = 2 * 0.718 * (500 - 300) = 287.2 kJ.

5. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The condenser's purpose in the Rankine cycle is to condense the exhaust steam from the turbine into saturated liquid, which can then be pumped to the boiler.

6. Correct Answer: C

32. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Using Carnot efficiency, η = 1 - (Tl/Th). Efficiency of the engine is 1 - (400/800) = 0.5. Work output is 200 kJ, so heat input is Qh = Work/η = 200/0.5 = 400 kJ. Heat rejected Ql = Qh - Work = 400 - 200 = 400 kJ.

42. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The change in internal energy is calculated using the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU = Q - W. Here, Q = 300 kJ and W = 100 kJ, so ΔU = 300 - 100 = 200 kJ.

43. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The Carnot efficiency defines the theoretical maximum efficiency a heat engine can achieve, based solely on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs.
