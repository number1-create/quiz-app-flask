--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The ABG shows a slightly low pH, elevated PaCO2, and a compensatory rise in HCO3, consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Increasing PEEP improves oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and enhancing gas exchange. Increasing FiO2 further may lead to oxygen toxicity.

3. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: In ARDS, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume (6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) and high PEEP is used to minimize barotrauma and improve oxygenation.

4. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: CT pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism due to its high sensitivity and specificity.

5. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: A right shift indicates decreased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen, enhancing oxygen unloading to tissues, common in acidosis, hypercapnia, and hyperthermia.

6. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Mechanical ventilation is often required in flail chest to stabilize the chest wall, improve oxygenation, and reduce the work of breathing.

7. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The sudden onset of dyspnea and diminished breath sounds on one side is characteristic of a pneumothorax.

8. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The immediate priority is to check for tube dislodgement, obstruction, pneumothorax, or equipment failure, often summarized as the DOPE mnemonic.

9. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: While fever, leukocytosis, and hypoxia are nonspecific, a new or progressive infiltrate on CXR strongly suggests VAP in a ventilated patient.

10. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: In an acute severe asthma exacerbation, hypoxemia and hypercapnia occur due to airway obstruction, leading to respiratory acidosis.

11. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The sharp pleuritic chest pain and hypoxemia are hallmark signs of a pulmonary embolism. ARDS and pleural effusion typically have a more gradual onset, and pneumothorax often presents with absent breath sounds on the affected side.

12. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The combination of decreased breath sounds on the right, hypotension, and tachycardia should raise suspicion for pneumothorax, especially in mechanically ventilated patients.

13. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: In COPD patients, the target oxygen saturation is 88-92% to prevent hypoxemia while avoiding the risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure due to oxygen-induced hypoventilation.

14. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The low pH and elevated PaCO2 indicate respiratory acidosis, which is commonly seen in conditions like pneumonia that impair ventilation.

15. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Ketamine is preferred in severe asthma due to its bronchodilatory effects. Rocuronium is a fast-acting paralytic suitable for rapid sequence intubation.

16. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Driving pressure is calculated as plateau pressure minus PEEP. In this case, 35 cm H2O - 15 cm H2O = 20 cm H2O.

17. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Restrictive lung disease is characterized by reduced lung volumes, including total lung capacity. The FEV1/FVC ratio is typically normal or increased.

18. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Pink frothy sputum and bilateral infiltrates are classic findings in acute pulmonary edema, often secondary to left ventricular failure or fluid overload.

19. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: In ARDS, increasing PEEP is preferred to improve oxygenation and prevent alveolar collapse while minimizing the risk of oxygen toxicity from high FiO2.

20. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The onset of fever, purulent sputum, and new infiltrates 72 hours after intubation is highly suggestive of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

21. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Patients with pulmonary fibrosis often require protective lung strategies with low tidal volumes and high PEEP to prevent further lung damage and optimize oxygenation.

22. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: While elevated D-dimer, widened A-a gradient, and hypocapnia are suggestive, a filling defect on CT pulmonary angiography is the most definitive diagnostic finding for pulmonary embolism.

23. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Prone positioning improves oxygenation in severe ARDS by redistributing ventilation and reducing lung compression. Increasing FiO2 to 1.0 is not sustainable long-term, and non-invasive ventilation is not appropriate for severe ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation.

24. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker commonly used for RSI due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. Propofol and midazolam are sedatives, and etomidate is an induction agent but not a paralytic.

   Explanation: The ABG shows respiratory acidosis (low pH, elevated PaCO2), consistent with acute respiratory failure due to asthma, and hypoxemia (low PaO2).

26. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The clinical scenario is consistent with a tension pneumothorax, which requires immediate needle decompression before imaging or other interventions.

27. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Using lower tidal volumes and monitoring plateau pressure (<30 cm H2O) reduces the risk of barotrauma in patients with ARDS.

28. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Increasing PEEP helps recruit collapsed alveoli, improving oxygenation in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Increasing FiO2 alone may not address the underlying issue.

29. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: A NIF of -30 cm H2O indicates adequate respiratory muscle strength for extubation. High FiO2 requirements, tachypnea, and high minute ventilation suggest the patient is not ready.

30. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The clinical scenario is consistent with acute pulmonary edema, where diuretics and afterload reduction are the mainstays of treatment.

31. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is appropriate for hypercapnic respiratory failure as seen in this patient's elevated PaCO2, which is a hallmark of ventilatory failure. It helps reduce the work of breathing and improves gas exchange.

32. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Prone positioning is indicated in ARDS to improve oxygenation and reduce lung stress due to worsening compliance. It helps redistribute ventilatory pressures more evenly while improving perfusion to less affected lung areas.

33. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is preferred in cases of suspected pulmonary abscess as it provides a direct sample from the affected lung area for microbiological and cytological analysis.

34. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosing VAP as it provides specific information about the presence of infectious organisms deep within the lungs.

35. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Low PaCO2, elevated pH, and normal bicarbonate levels indicate respiratory alkalosis, often caused by hyperventilation.

36. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: In acute pulmonary edema, CPAP improves oxygenation by reducing preload and afterload, thereby decreasing the work of breathing and improving ventilation-perfusion matching.

37. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: A pH of 7.30 and PaCO2 of 50 mmHg indicate respiratory acidosis, a sign of impending respiratory failure due to inadequate alveolar ventilation in the setting of severe asthma.

38. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Severe hypoxemia despite high PEEP and FiO2 is characteristic of ARDS, a syndrome of diffuse alveolar damage and impaired gas exchange.

39. Correct Answer: B
