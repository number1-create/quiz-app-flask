--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: When a bond is trading below its par value, it is considered a discount bond. In this case, the yield to maturity is higher than the coupon rate because the investor will gain both the interest payments and the difference between the purchase price and par value at maturity.

2. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Interest rate risk refers to the risk that a bond's value will decline due to rising interest rates. When rates increase, the price of existing bonds falls because newer bonds offer higher yields.

3. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Money market funds invest in short-term, low-risk securities and are designed to provide income while maintaining capital preservation. They are ideal for conservative investors looking for stability.

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Currency risk arises when the value of a foreign currency fluctuates against an investor's home currency. This can affect the returns from foreign investments.

5. Correct Answer: C
