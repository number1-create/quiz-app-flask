   Explanation: The total load is calculated using the area of the circle (πr²) and the distributed load: π × (2 m)² × 100 N/m² = 1256 N.

71. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total distributed load is calculated by multiplying the load intensity by the beam length: 200 N/m × 5 m = 1000 N. Since the beam is supported symmetrically, each support will take half of the load. Therefore, the reaction force at the pin support is 1000 N.
72. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: For a triangular plate, the centroid is located at a distance of 2/3 from the vertex (or 1/3 from the base). The vertical distance from the base is therefore (2/3) × 4 m = 2.67 m.

73. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using static equilibrium, summing moments about the left support yields the reaction at the right support: (500 N × 3 m) / 8 m = 312.5 N.

74. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The sum of moments about the left end allows calculation of the tension in the right cable: (300 N × 4 m + 200 N × 5 m) / 10 m = 380 N.

75. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The maximum force is determined by static friction, which is μ × N. The normal force N = 250 N × cos(30°), and μ = 0.4. Therefore, F_max = 0.4 × (250 N × cos(30°)) = 100 N.

76. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total load is obtained by multiplying the load intensity by the length: 300 N/m × 6 m = 1800 N. Reaction forces balance the total load, so the combined reaction is 1800 N.

77. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The horizontal member resists the vertical load, creating a compressive force equal to the applied load due to symmetry and equilibrium.

78. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The moment at the fixed end is calculated as the point load multiplied by the distance from the fixed end: M = 200 N × 4 m = 800 Nm.

79. Correct Answer: A

80. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The centroid is calculated using the weighted average of the areas and their individual centroids. For the semicircle, centroid is at 4r/3π from the base; for the rectangle, it is at its center.

81. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The total load for a triangular distributed load is (1/2 × base × height). Here, base = 10 m and height = 600 N/m. Total load = (1/2 × 10 × 600) = 3000 N.

82. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: In a Warren truss, diagonal members typically experience greater axial forces under vertical loads due to their orientation and load path.

83. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The component of the block's weight parallel to the incline exceeds the maximum possible static friction, thus causing the block to slide.

84. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The total load is 8000 N (1000 N/m × 8 m). Since the beam is symmetric and simply supported, each support carries half the total load, which is 5000 N.

85. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The centroid is calculated using the area-weighted average of the individual centroids of the two rectangles.

86. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The ladder remains stationary if the friction force at the base is higher than the horizontal force exerted by the wall.

87. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The moment at the pinned support is calculated as the force multiplied by its perpendicular distance to the support (400 N × 2 m).

88. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The total load equals the area of the triangular load distribution: 0.5 × base × height = 0.5 × 10 m × 500 N/m = 2500 N.

89. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The horizontal reaction at the pinned corner equals the applied horizontal load since the roller support cannot resist horizontal forces.

90. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Using equilibrium equations and trigonometry, the tension is resolved based on the angles and the vertical load distribution.

91. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The tipping force is calculated by equating moments due to the applied force and the block's weight about the tipping edge.

92. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Start by summing the vertical forces. The total downward force is 100 N, which must be balanced by the upward reaction forces at the supports. Using moments about the left support, the reaction at the right support is calculated as (100 * 1) / 4 = 50 N.

93. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Resolve equilibrium forces in the vertical and horizontal directions. The vertical component of the tensions must balance the weight of the object. Using trigonometric relationships, tension in the 30° cable is calculated as T = (300 * 9.81) / (sin 30° + sin 60°).

94. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The moment at the fixed support is calculated as the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance to the point of rotation. Moment = 200 N * 5 m = 2000 Nm.

95. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The force required to overcome static friction is given by F = μ * Normal Force. Here, F = 0.4 * 500 = 200 N.

96. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using similar triangles and the geometry of the truss, resolve the forces using equilibrium equations. Horizontal forces are distributed proportionally based on the lengths of the members.

97. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The force is symmetrically distributed between the two vertical members due to the symmetric placement of the load. Each vertical member supports 250 N.

98. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The total load is calculated by multiplying the distributed load by the length of the beam. Total load = 300 N/m * 6 m = 1800 N.

99. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The center of gravity is calculated using the weighted average of the centroids: CG = [(500 * 2) + (300 * 1)] / (500 + 300) = 1.625 m.

100. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The shear force is constant between the left support and the load. The reaction at the left support is 400 N, which remains unchanged until the position of the load.

101. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the equation for determinacy (m = 2j - 3), m = 6 and 2j - 3 = 6. Since both sides are equal, the structure is statically determinate.

102. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Displacement is calculated as Force divided by stiffness: Δ = F/k = 200 N / 100 N/mm = 1.0 mm.

103. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The weight is evenly distributed, so each leg supports 600 N / 3 = 200 N.

104. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Angular momentum L = Iω, where I = mr² for a wheel. I = 50 * 2² = 200 kg·m², so L = 200 * 4 = 800 kg·m²/s.

105. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The mechanical advantage indicates that the force applied is multiplied by 4. Maximum weight lifted = applied force * mechanical advantage = 100 * 4 = 400 N.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---
1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The acceleration is calculated as a = g * sin(θ). Substituting g = 9.8 m/s² and θ = 30°, we get a = 9.8 * sin(30°) = 4.9 m/s².

2. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using the kinematic equation v² = u² + 2as, where v = 20 m/s, u = 0 m/s, and s = 100 m, solving for a gives a = v² / (2s) = (20)² / (2 * 100) = 2 m/s².

3. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The natural frequency is given by f = (1/2π) * √(k/m). Substituting k = 200 N/m and m = 2 kg, f = (1/2π) * √(200/2) = 1.6 Hz.

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Net force is F_net = F_applied - F_friction. F_friction = μ * N = μ * m * g. Substituting μ = 0.2, m = 15 kg, g = 9.8 m/s², F_friction = 0.2 * 15 * 9.8 = 29.4 N. Net force = 60 - 29.4 = 30.6 N. Acceleration = F_net / m = 30.6 / 15 = 1.6 m/s².

5. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The maximum height is given by h = (v₀² * sin²θ) / (2g). Substituting v₀ = 14 m/s, θ = 45°, and g = 9.8 m/s², h = (14² * sin²(45)) / (2 * 9.8) = 7.0 m.

6. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The damped frequency ω_d is given by ω_d = ω_n * √(1 - ζ²), where ζ = damping ratio and ω_n = undamped natural frequency. Substituting ζ = 0.5, ω_n = 8 rad/s, ω_d = 8 * √(1 - 0.5²) = 6.9 rad/s.

7. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Centripetal acceleration is a_c = v² / r. Substituting v = 4 m/s and r = 2 m, a_c = (4²) / 2 = 8 m/s².

8. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the equation s = ut + 0.5at², where u = 0, a = 2 m/s², and t = 10 s, s = 0 + 0.5 * 2 * (10)² = 100 m.

9. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The period of a pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g). Substituting L = 0.5 m and g = 9.8 m/s², T = 2π√(0.5/9.8) ≈ 1.4 s.

10. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Centripetal force is F_c = mv² / r. Substituting m = 1000 kg, v = 20 m/s, and r = 50 m, F_c = (1000 * 20²) / 50 = 16000 N.

11. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The acceleration is calculated by resolving the forces into components, accounting for the effect of friction, and applying Newton's second law.

12. Correct Answer: B

   Explanation: Centripetal force is calculated using Fc = mv²/r, where m is the mass, v is the speed, and r is the radius of the circular path.

15. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The distance is calculated using the equation s = ut + 0.5at², where u is the initial velocity and a is the deceleration.

16. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The damping ratio is calculated using ζ = c / (2√(km)), where c is the damping coefficient, k is the spring constant, and m is the mass.

17. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The acceleration is found by resolving forces parallel to the incline, factoring in the frictional force, and using Newton's second law.

18. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The final velocity is calculated using v = u + at, where u is the initial velocity (0 m/s) and a is the acceleration.

19. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The period of a pendulum is calculated using T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is the gravitational acceleration.

20. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The orbital speed is calculated using v = √(GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the orbital radius.

21. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Since the crate is moving at a constant velocity, the net force along the incline is zero. The applied force must counteract both the parallel component of weight and the friction force. F_applied = m*g*sin(20°) + μ_k*m*g*cos(20°).

22. Correct Answer: B

41. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The maximum static friction force is f_s = μ_s * N = 0.4 * (20 * 9.81) = 78.48 N. Since the applied force (80 N) exceeds this value, the box will overcome static friction and move. The net force causing acceleration is F_net = 80 - (0.3 * 20 * 9.81) = 21.87 N, so the box will accelerate.

42. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: At maximum height, the velocity becomes zero. Using the equation v = u - g*t, where u is the initial velocity, we get 0 = 12 - 9.81*t. Solving for t gives t = 1.22 seconds.

48. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The distance during the first phase is s1 = v*t = 40*10 = 400 m. During deceleration, s2 = 0.5*(v+u)*t = 0.5*(40+0)*5 = 100 m. Total distance is s1 + s2 = 400 + 300 = 700 m.

52. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The force of static friction is given by F_friction = μ_s * N. Here, μ_s = 0.4, N = mg = (10)(9.8) = 98 N. So, F_friction = (0.4)(98) = 39.2 N. The block will move with a force slightly greater than 39.2 N, which is approximately 40 N.

53. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Deceleration is calculated using a = (v - u)/t. Here, v = 0, u = 20 m/s, t = 5 s. So, a = (0 - 20)/5 = -4 m/s². The deceleration magnitude is 4 m/s².

   Explanation: Thermal stress is calculated using σ = α × ΔT × E. Substituting α = 12 × 10^-6 /°C, ΔT = 50°C, and E = 200 × 10^9 Pa, σ = 12 × 10^-6 × 50 × 200 × 10^9 = 240 MPa.

103. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the Goodman relation, combined stress = mean stress + alternating stress = 150 + 100 = 250 MPa. Since this equals the endurance limit, the component will not fail.

104. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Maximum principal stress is calculated using σ_1 = [(σ_x + σ_y)/2] + √[((σ_x - σ_y)/2)^2 + τ_xy^2]. Substituting values, σ_1 = [(60 + 30)/2] + √[((60 - 30)/2)^2 + 15^2] = 80 MPa.

105. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Shear modulus G is calculated using G = E / [2(1 + ν)]. Substituting E = 210 × 10^9 Pa and ν = 0.3, G = 210 × 10^9 / [2(1 + 0.3)] = 77.78 GPa.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The pressure due to a liquid column is calculated using P = ρgh. Substituting values: P = (1000 kg/m³)(9.81 m/s²)(10 m) = 98,100 Pa = 98.1 kPa.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the continuity equation: A1V1 = A2V2. With A = πd²/4, A1 = π(0.5)²/4, A2 = π(0.25)²/4. Solving for V2: V2 = V1(A1/A2) = 3 m/s × [(0.5²)/(0.25²)] = 12 m/s.

3. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using Bernoulli's equation: P1 + ρgh1 + 0.5ρv1² = P2 + ρgh2 + 0.5ρv2². Substitute values, rearrange for P2, and calculate: P2 = P1 + ρg(h1-h2).

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Reynolds number is calculated as Re = (ρVD)/μ. Substituting values: Re = (1000)(2)(0.05)/(0.001) = 4000.

5. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Darcy-Weisbach equation: hf = f(L/D)(v²/2g). Calculate f using empirical methods or given directly, then substitute into the equation.

6. Correct Answer: A

9. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: All listed devices measure flow based on pressure differences caused by changes in velocity and area.

10. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Mach number is calculated as M = V/a, where V is the velocity and a is the speed of sound. M = 340/300 = 1.13.

11. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The force exerted by the water on the wall is calculated using pressure distribution. Pressure at the bottom is ρgh = 1000 * 9.8 * 2 = 19,600 Pa. Since pressure varies linearly, the average pressure is 9,800 Pa. The area of the wall is 2 * 1 = 2 m². Total force = Average Pressure * Area = 9,800 * 2 = 19,600 N.

12. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using the continuity equation A₁v₁ = A₂v₂. The area at A is π(0.1/2)² = 0.00785 m², and the area at B is π(0.05/2)² = 0.00196 m². Solving 0.00785 * 2 = 0.00196 * v₂ yields v₂ = 8 m/s.

13. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Kinematic viscosity ν = μ / ρ. Given μ = 0.001 Pa·s and ρ = 1000 kg/m³, ν = 0.001 / 1000 = 1 × 10⁻³ m²/s.

14. Correct Answer: C

171. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: In a rigid container, the volume of the system does not change, meaning no boundary work is done. By the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W. Since W = 0, ΔU = Q. Therefore, all the heat goes into increasing the internal energy of the gas, and no work is done.

172. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The coefficient of performance (COP) for a Carnot refrigerator is COP = Tc / (Th - Tc), where temperatures are in Kelvin. Converting to Kelvin: Tc = 278 K and Th = 303 K. COP = 278 / (303 - 278) = 11.12. Work input, W, is given by W = Qc / COP = 250 / 11.12 ≈ 25.0 kJ.

173. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: For an isentropic process, the relationship T1/T2 = (P1/P2)^(k-1/k) applies, where k = 1.4 for air. T2 = T1 × (P2/P1)^((k-1)/k). Substituting: T2 = 300 × (200/500)^(0.4/1.4) ≈ 240 K.

174. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: As the air is cooled at constant pressure, its temperature approaches the dew point. At 10°C, the dew point is reached, and the air becomes saturated. Further cooling results in condensation as water vapor condenses out of the air.

175. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Thermal efficiency for a Rankine cycle is η = (Wt - Qc) / Qh, where Wt = turbine work and Qh = heat added. Here, Wt = 3200 - 2100 = 1100 kJ/kg and Qc = 2100 - 900 = 1200 kJ/kg. Qh = heat added = 3200 - 900 = 2300 kJ/kg. Thus, η = (1100) / (2300) = 0.478, or approximately 40%.
