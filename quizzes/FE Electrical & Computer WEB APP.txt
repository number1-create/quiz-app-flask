   Explanation: The actual reactance is X_actual = X_pu × V_base^2 / S_base. Here, X_pu = 1.5, V_base = 13.8 kV, S_base = 120 MVA. X_actual = 1.5 × (13.8^2) / 120 = 1.85 Ω.

142. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The current is calculated as I = Q / (√3 × V). Here, Q = 200 kVAR, V = 11 kV. Thus, I = 200,000 / (√3 × 11,000) ≈ 16.2 A.

143. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Frequency deviation Δf = ΔP × t / (2 × H × MVA). Here, ΔP = 50 MW, t = 0.5 s, H = 5 MJ/MVA, MVA = 100. Δf = 50 × 0.5 / (2 × 5 × 100) = 1.0 Hz.

146. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The fault current is calculated as 1 / (Xg + Xt + Xl), where Xg, Xt, and Xl are the reactances of the generator, transformer, and line, respectively. Substituting values gives 6.25 p.u.

147. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: THD is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the harmonic currents divided by the fundamental current. Substituting values: THD = sqrt(30^2 + 20^2) / 200 = 16.1%.

148. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The real power delivered is calculated as P = Rated Power × Efficiency × Power Factor. Substituting values: P = 500 × 0.96 × 0.99 = 494.4 kW.

149. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The total shunt admittance is calculated as Yshunt = Yper-km × length. Substituting values: Yshunt = j0.0001 × 200 = 0.02 S per half-length, so total admittance is 0.04 S.

150. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The rate of change of frequency is calculated using df/dt = ΔP / (2H × f). Substituting values: df/dt = 0.2 / (2 × 6 × 60) = 0.5 Hz/s.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: To determine viability, calculate the present value using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. For FV = $15,000, r = 0.08, and n = 5, the present value is greater than $10,000, making the project viable.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The straight-line depreciation method calculates annual expense as (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life. For this case: ($50,000 - $5,000) / 10 = $5,000.

3. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Calculate the present value of operating costs using the formula PV = Annual Cost × (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r and add the initial cost. Equipment B has a lower total cost when discounted.

4. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The break-even point is calculated as Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Cost per Unit), which is $30,000 / ($50 - $20) = 1,000 units.

5. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The PV of annuities is calculated as PV = PMT × (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r. Substituting PMT = $5,000, r = 0.07, and n = 6 gives PV ≈ $26,760.

6. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Profitability Index = Present Value of Cash Flows / Initial Investment. Discount the cash flows and divide by $200,000 to obtain PI = 1.10.

7. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Future Value = Present Value × (1 + Inflation Rate)^n. Substituting $1,000, 0.03, and 5 gives FV ≈ $1,159.

8. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flows. Substituting $50,000 and $12,000 gives ≈ 4.5 years.

9. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Using trial and error or financial calculator, the rate of return is found by solving the IRR equation for cash inflows of $6,000 annually for 8 years.

10. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Monthly payment is calculated using the amortization formula. Substituting the loan amount, interest rate, and time period gives ≈ $1,479.

11. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: EAC = (Initial Cost + PV of Operating Costs) × Discount Factor / Annuity Factor. Machine B has the lower EAC when calculated.

12. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The net present value of leasing ($2,000 * 12 * 3 discounted at 5%) is higher than purchasing and maintaining the server ($60,000 + discounted $6,000 for 3 years).

13. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The initial cost is added to the present worth of annual maintenance ((2,000 * Annuity factor at 8% for 10 years) = $13,000). Total = $20,000 + $13,000 = $33,000.

14. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: NPV is calculated by discounting cash flows ($20,000 * Annuity factor for 5 years at 6%) and adding the discounted salvage value ($10,000 / 1.06^5), then subtracting the initial investment.

15. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The present worth of Tool Y’s costs (initial cost + discounted annual maintenance for 8 years) is less than the upfront cost of Tool X.

16. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The IRR is the discount rate that sets the NPV to zero. Using the trial-and-error method or financial calculator, the cash flows discounted at 16% precisely equal the $120,000 investment.

17. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Using the loan amortization formula, the annual payment is calculated as ($300,000 * 0.06 * (1+0.06)^10)/((1+0.06)^10 - 1).

18. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: MARR is calculated using the formula (1+Nominal)/(1+Inflation) - 1, resulting in approximately 6.86%.

19. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The PV of each cash inflow is calculated separately and summed: ($10,000/1.07 + $15,000/1.07^2 + $20,000/1.07^3).

20. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The total present worth of the new machine is less than the old machine when maintenance costs are discounted over 10 years.

21. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Profit = Revenue - Variable Costs - Fixed Costs. After-tax profit = (Profit - Taxes) = ($200,000-$80,000-$50,000)*(1-0.30).

22. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The net present value (NPV) is calculated using a discount rate of 8%. If the NPV is positive, the investment is justified; otherwise, it is not.

23. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The NPV of each project is calculated by discounting the cash flows at 10%. Project Y has a higher NPV because of its longer cash flow duration and higher annual returns.

24. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The NPV is calculated by discounting each year’s cash flow and summing them up, then subtracting the initial cost.

25. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) is calculated by dividing the present value of the benefits by the present value of the costs. A ratio greater than 1 indicates a favorable investment.

26. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of the project becomes zero. Trial-and-error or financial calculator tools are used to find this rate.

27. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The loan repayment amount is computed using the formula for amortization, taking into account the interest rate and duration of payments.

28. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The real rate of return is calculated using the formula: Real Rate = (1 + Nominal Rate) / (1 + Inflation Rate) - 1.

29. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The payback period is calculated by dividing the initial cost by the annual cash flows. Project B has a shorter payback period despite its higher initial cost.

30. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The future price is calculated using the formula: Future Price = Present Price × (1 + Inflation Rate)^n, where n is the number of years.

31. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The break-even point is calculated using: Break-even Units = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Costs).

32. Correct Answer: A
