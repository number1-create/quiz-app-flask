1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: The mechanical advantage of the lever is calculated as the ratio of the lengths of the effort arm to the load arm. Here, the effort arm is 8 feet (10 - 2), and the load arm is 2 feet, giving a mechanical advantage of 8/2 = 4. Therefore, the required force is 200 / 4 = 50 pounds.

2. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: In a hydraulic system, pressure is transmitted equally in all directions. Pressure on the smaller piston = Force / Area = 50 / 2 = 25 psi. This same pressure is applied to the larger piston, so Force = Pressure x Area = 25 x 20 = 500 pounds.
