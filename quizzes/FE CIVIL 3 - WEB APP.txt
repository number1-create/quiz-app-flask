--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, a(t) = dv/dt = 6t - 6. At t = 2, a(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 6 m/s².

2. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Force is given by F = ma. First, calculate acceleration: a = (v - u)/t = (20 - 0)/10 = 2 m/s². Then, F = 1500 × 2 = 3000 N.

3. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Work done = Force × Distance. Friction force = μ × m × g = 0.2 × 5 × 9.8 = 9.8 N. Net force = 20 - 9.8 = 10.2 N. Net work = 10.2 × 10 = 130 J.

4. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Impulse = Change in momentum = m(v_final - v_initial) = 0.5(-6 - 10) = -8 N·s. Impulse magnitude is 12 N·s.

5. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Linear velocity v = rω = 0.5 × 4 = 2 m/s.

6. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Torque τ = Iα. For a disk, I = (1/2)mr² = (1/2)(2)(1)² = 1 kg·m². α = τ/I = 4/1 = 4 rad/s².

7. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Potential energy U = (1/2)kx² = (1/2)(100)(0.2)² = 2 J.

8. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Using elastic collision equations and conservation laws, solve for the final velocity of the 5 kg object. Simplified calculation gives v = 4 m/s.

9. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Horizontal reaction force is determined by resolving forces using trigonometric components and equilibrium conditions. Force = 150 × cos(60°) = 75 N.

10. Correct Answer: B

Area for shear is the perimeter of the hollow section multiplied by wall thickness: A = 2[(150 + 300) - 2 × 20] × 20 = 13600 mm² = 1.36 × 10⁻² m². τ = (30 × 10³) / (1.36 × 10⁻²) = 3 × 10⁶ Pa = 3 MPa.

94. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Maximum shear stress in a circular shaft is calculated using τ_max = (T × r) / J. Here, r = d/2 = 40/2 = 20 mm = 0.02 m. J = πd⁴ / 32 = π(0.04)⁴ / 32 = 2.51 × 10⁻⁷ m⁴. τ_max = (200 × 0.02) / (2.51 × 10⁻⁷) = 127.3 MPa.

95. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Maximum normal stress due to combined loading is σ_max = σ_axial + σ_bending. Axial stress, σ_axial = P/A = (50 × 10³) / (400 × 10⁻⁶) = 125 MPa. Bending stress, σ_bending = M/S = (10 × 10³) / (200 × 10⁻⁶) = 50 MPa. Total σ_max = 125 + 50 = 175 MPa.

96. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Circumferential stress is calculated using σ_c = (P × r) / t. Here, r = d/2 = 1.2/2 = 0.6 m. t = 15 mm = 0.015 m. σ_c = (2 × 0.6) / 0.015 = 80 MPa.

97. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Elastic strain is calculated using ε = σ / E. Here, σ = 150 MPa = 150 × 10⁶ Pa, E = 200 GPa = 200 × 10⁹ Pa. ε = (150 × 10⁶) / (200 × 10⁹) = 0.00075.

98. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Maximum deflection for a cantilever beam with UDL is δ = (w × L⁴) / (8 × EI). Here, w = 2 × 10³ N/m, L = 3 m, EI = 100 × 10³ Nm². δ = (2 × 10³ × 3⁴) / (8 × 100 × 10³) = 1.8 mm.

99. Correct Answer: A
   Explanation: Thermal stress is calculated using σ = α × E × ΔT. Here, α = 12 × 10⁻⁶/°C, E = 200 × 10⁹ Pa, ΔT = -30°C. σ = (12 × 10⁻⁶) × (200 × 10⁹) × (-30) = 72 MPa.

100. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Critical buckling load is given by P_cr = (π² × E × I) / (K × L)². Here, I = r² × A; assume cross-section and intermediary values. Solve based on assumptions.

--- CORRECT ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS ---

1. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The degree of saturation (S) is calculated using the formula S = (w * Gs) / e, where w is the water content, Gs is the specific gravity, and e is the void ratio. Substituting values: S = (0.20 * 2.70) / 0.65 = 0.83 or 80%.

2. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is τ = c + σ'tan(ϕ). Rearrange for cohesion: c = (σ1 - σ3)/2 - (σ1+σ3)/2 * tan(ϕ). Substituting values: c = (120 - 60)/2 - (120+60)/2 * tan(30°) = 30 kPa.

3. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The formula for ultimate bearing capacity is qu = cNc + γDfNq + 0.5γBNγ. Since cohesion is 0 and depth Df is ignored, qu = 0.5 * γ * B * Nγ. Substituting values: qu = 0.5 * 18 * 2 * 19.7 = 950 kPa.

4. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The time factor for 90% consolidation (Tv) is approximately 0.848. Use Tv = Cv * t / H². Rearranging for t: t = Tv * H² / Cv. Substituting values: t = 0.848 * (200)² / 0.005 = 5 years.

5. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: Increasing the compaction effort allows for greater rearrangement and packing of soil particles, thereby increasing the maximum dry density.

6. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: The factor of safety is calculated using FS = (c + γz tan(ϕ)) / (γz). Substituting values: FS = (20 + 18*10*tan(30°)) / (18*10) = 1.5.

7. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: Ka = tan²(45° - ϕ/2). Substituting ϕ = 30°: Ka = tan²(45° - 30°/2) = tan²(30°) = 0.42.

8. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The flow rate per unit area (q) is given by q = k*i, where k is the hydraulic conductivity and i is the hydraulic gradient. Substituting values: q = (2 x 10^-4 m/s) * 0.05 = 2 x 10^-5 m²/s.

9. Correct Answer: C
   Explanation: The time factor for 90% (Tv90) is approximately 4 times that for 50% (Tv50). Since settlement is proportional to Tv: t90 ≈ 4 * t50 = 4 * 1 year = 4 years.

15. Correct Answer: B
   Explanation: Time factor for 50% consolidation (T_v) is 0.197. Using T_v = (C_v * t) / H², solve for t. H = 5 m (since drainage occurs from both sides). t = T_v * H² / C_v = 0.197 * (5²) / 0.002 = 3.7 years.

16. Correct Answer: D
   Explanation: The shear strength is given by τ = c + σn * tan(φ). Substituting values, τ = 20 + 50 * tan(35°). Using tan(35°) ≈ 0.700, τ = 20 + 50 * 0.700 = 62.5 kPa.
